# SokoShell

Version 0.1

### How to debug and keep autocompletion?

For IntelliJ IDEA:
* Create a `Remote JVM Debug` configuration. Values by default are great.
* Start sokoshell with `sh sokoshell-in-terminal.sh debug`
* Wait until the compilation is finished
* Start the previously created `Remote JVM Debug` configuration.
